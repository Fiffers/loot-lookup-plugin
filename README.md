## Planned

- Filter drop table sections
- Sort each section individually by item name, quantity, rarity, and price
- Alternate view options for results - grid, etc.
- Replace OSRS Wiki scraping with [OSRSBox](https://www.osrsbox.com/) data pending [#161](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db/issues/161)
